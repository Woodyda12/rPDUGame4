# Grid Glider – Design for Cost Edition

A simple endless runner built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) showcasing cost-saving principles in an engineering context. Glide over a glowing grid, dodge symbolic obstacles and rack up the highest score you can.

## Setup
No installation required. Clone or download this repository and open `index.html` in any modern desktop web browser.

## Controls
- **Left / Right Arrows** or **A / D** – move the player left or right
- **R** – restart after game over

## Gameplay
Avoid oncoming obstacles as they move toward you. Your score increases the longer you survive and the speed slowly ramps up. Colliding with an obstacle ends the run.

## Assets
Obstacle textures are provided in this repository under the `assets/` directory
as `obstacle1.png` through `obstacle5.png` and are loaded directly by the game.

Enjoy and feel free to modify or extend the game!
